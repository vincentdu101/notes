# details of the data science process
Computer Science - Data Wrangling
  acquire - data ingestion (web scraping, crawling)
  parse -  
Statistics and Data Mining - EDA
  filter
  mine
Graphic Design
  represent
  refine
Infovis (Info Visualization) and HCI (Human Computer Interaction)
  interact

EDA - exploratory data analysis

# Data Types
quantitative data - continuous, discrete, countable
categorical data 
  nominal - categorizes data into groups, geographic for example
  ordered - bins of data (0 - 10 million, 10 - 100 million, 100 - 500 million)

# visual encodings 
data map to display elements
position is considered planar variables (x and y coordinate plotting)
retinal variables 
  size difference of shapes (bubbles, circles)
  color differences of shapes

orientation - direction up or down
more accurate --> less accurate
position, length, angle or shape, area, volume, color or density

# double encoding
using two different visual encoding to describe the same data
