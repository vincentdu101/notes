near the sum of 2 numbers is the sum of 2 nearby numbers

lim(f(x) + g(x)) as x -> a (as x approaches a)

lim f(x) + lim g(x)
x -> a     x -> a

limit of sum is the sum of the limits

lim (x^2 + x)
x -> 2

= (lim x^2) + lim x
  x -> 2      x -> 2

= lim(x * x) + 2
  x -> 2

= lim(x) * lim(x) + 2
  x -> 2    x -> 2
  2 *       2     + 2

= 6

limit of a sum is the sum of the limits provided the limit exists

f(x) = sin (1/x)

lim sin(1/x) as x -> 0
does not exist because the values fluctuage so much
the values don't reach a number as x approaches 0

to say lim f(x) = L as x -> a 
means f(x) can be made as close to L as desired by making x close enough to a

f(x) = sin (pie / x)

f(0.01) = sin (pie / 0.01)
        = sin (100pie)

f(x) = sin (pie / x)

lim f(x) = -sqrt(3) / 2 as x -> 0

limit does not exist, when applied with 0.7 and 0.007, 0.0007 the values arent approaching a certain number

f(x) = (sin x) / x

lim f(x) = (sin x) / x as x -> 0 
lim = 1 

- the promise is that as long as the input is close to 0 the output will be close enough to 1
- how close to 1 depends on close the input is to 0

squeeze theorem
g(x) <= f(x) <= h(x) as x near a 
lim g(x) = lim h(x) = L
x -> a     x -> a
then lim f(x) = L
     x -> a

cos x < (sin x) / x < L

lim cos x = 1
x -> 0

lim 1 = 1
x -> 0

the limit is also = 1 because of the squeeze theorem
lim (sin x / x)
x -> 0
