Functions 
- assigns to each number in its domain another domain
- unless I say otherwise, the domain consists of all numbers
  for which the rule makes sense

f(2) = 4
f(3) = 9
f(4) = 16
f(5) = 25

make a rule for the pattern
f(x) = x^2

f(x) = 1 / x

- to divide by x, must have x != 0
- domain f is all real numbers not 0

g(x) = x^2 if x >= 5
     = 2x  if x < 5

- how to tell if functions are the same
YES they are the same
f(x) = (1 + x)^2 
g(x) = x^2+ 2x + 1

f(2) = (1 + 2)^2 = 9
g(2) = 2^2 + 2*2 + 1 = 9

- for every input value they have the same output value
NO they are not the same
f(x) = x^2 / x  
g(x) = x

0^2 / 0  ====> undefined
0

- how can more functions be made
f(x) = x ===> identity function (whatever you plugin the output is that)
f(x) = c ===> constant function (whatever you plugin the output ignores it)
f(x) = ax + b ===> polynomial function 

f(x) = x^n ===> polynomial function

f(x) = sin x (cos x) (tan x) ===> trig function 

take outpit of first function and plug it into the second function as input

# real example functions

- celcius to fahrenheit
f(x) = 9x / 5 + 32
