# A view is commonly known as a virtual table
# A view is a virtual table based on the result set of the SQL statement
# A view consists of a SELECT statement that is stored as an object in the database
# The tables referenced in the Views are known as a base table
# Technically views do not store any data. The data are retrieved at run
# time from the base tables
# MySQL supports nested view â€“ a view that is based on another view
# MySQL does not support materialized view
